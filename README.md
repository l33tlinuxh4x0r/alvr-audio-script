# alvr-audio-script
ALVR Audio Script to get audio (sound and mic) working on a ALVR supported device (meta quest).
This script is for Linux and pipewire. It probably won't work on mac and does NOT work on Windows.

# How to/Usage...
1. Download script
2. Put it in home directory
3. run `chmod a+x ~/alvr-audio.sh`
4. Open ALVR
5. Go to Settings
6. Set "On connect script" and "On disconnect script" both to the full path where the script is. ex. `/home/l33tlinuxh4x0r/alvr-audio.sh` (you may need to press "enter" after typing the path for settings to take effect.) Note: you need the full path, wildcards and variables do NOT work.
7. Start SteamVR via ALVR and enjoy!
